### Course Description:
This course will analyze the causes and consequences of international trade. We start by studying why nations trade, what they trade, and who gains (or not) from this trade. We will then
analyze the motives for countries or organizations to restrict or regulate international trade and
study the effects of such policies on economic welfare. The course will also cover topics such
as effects of trade on economic growth and wage inequality, international trade agreements and
current trade policy disputes. At the completion of this course, students will be able to:
* Gain factual knowledge about international trade
* Understand and examine trade related policy questions
* Respond intelligently to popular discussions of economic issues
